# Lifecycle recovery checks (G26 / T31)

Run on macOS from the repository root:

- `python3 tools/lifecycle-harness/update.py`
- `tools/test-hotkey-lifecycle.sh`
- `tools/test-resume-lifecycle.sh`
- `bash -n tools/self-update.sh tools/test-hotkey-lifecycle.sh tools/test-resume-lifecycle.sh`

Each runner retains its sources, output and SHA256 manifest in an owned temporary directory. Resume also records every source hash and the exact boundary patch. `MLS_LIFECYCLE_SOURCE_ROOT` selects a frozen source tree. `MLS_LIFECYCLE_BASE_REF=01ec682` runs the recorder/resume checks against the pre-fix production sources; `MLS_UPDATE_SCRIPT` selects a saved baseline updater script. The same assertions must fail on that baseline.

The updater executes the production shell script with only its log destination redirected. Real owned files, archives, shell processes, copies and renames are used. Network download, LaunchServices, and selected copy/rename failures are controlled at the command boundary. Cases cover offline download, bad archive, failed build/copy/install/launch/rollback, retained recovery backup, log creation/open failure, explicit old-process exit and timeout, literal path quoting, safe cleanup and success. One accepted app launch is expected after ordinary failure or success; the rejected new-launch case has two launch requests but only the restored old launch is accepted. No `open -n` is used. If restoration itself fails, the previous bundle remains in its named backup directory and the report gives that path. LaunchServices acceptance is **not** proof that a particular new process is running.

The hotkey check compiles unchanged Config and production HotkeyRecorderWindow with only its private window-construction method exposed in the test copy. It creates the actual hidden NSWindow and verifies its delegate wiring; the window notification goes through AppKit registration rather than calling the delegate method directly. It invokes the actual record-button action, sends local NSEvents and local application/window notifications, and checks completion callbacks and the owned configuration. Losing focus during an unfinished modifier chord, closing and Escape must cancel without changing the hotkey; normal completion must still save it. No window is shown.

The resume check compiles all production app files including AppDelegate, StatusBarUI, Engine and EventTap. Only CGEvent creation/enable are replaced with private Mach-port creation and a refusal switch; production EventTap run-loop ownership remains active. The AppDelegate config directory is owned, the permission boundary is controlled, focus trust returns false before any external AX query, status menus are built without installing a status item, and alerts are recorded without presentation. The actual menu action drives pause, rejected resume and successful retry. A separate failed initial Engine.start checks dictation pause and absence of further focus reads. Main's top-level NSApplication.run is replaced by the bounded test driver. No real tap, microphone, settings window, installed bundle or private editor is accessed.

The tests cover these lifecycle boundaries. They do not establish actual LaunchServices process identity, physical cross-application input, microphone behavior, or permission grant/revoke on the user's app.
